# Portfolio-Thomas_Park
Here are materials pertaining to the tech/IT career of Thomas Park (mystifiedthomas at gmail dot com).

I have an avid interest in pursuing a career in data analysis, development support or related positions. My most recent position was at Data Verify as a full time IT Coordinator. I have over 3 years of corporate experience as a Data Analyst, and 15 months of professional software development experience (Hussmann Corporation, 3/2019-6/2020) In 2021, I assembled curriculum for and taught Python and Data Analytics for 2 Savvy Coder cohorts. I have in 2018 completed Launchcode's "Discovery" and "LC-101" programs. I was given a pass for the "Liftoff" program, due to my hard work and coding achievements. I have completed two Gale courses, one on Javascript and one on Visual Basic. I am familiar with Python, Tableau, Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, CSS, HTML, SQL, Splunk, Jira, Visual Basic, Flask, Jinja, Git, Command Line and Computer Science essentials. I have created hundreds of fully functioning web apps.
