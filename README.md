Here are materials pertaining to the tech/IT career of Thomas Park (mystifiedthomas at gmail dot com).

I have an avid interest in pursuing a career in data analysis, development support or related technological positions. I have over 4 years of corporate experience as a Data Analyst, and 18 months of professional software development experience (SpearTip Corporation, 11/2022-2/2023, Hussmann Corporation, 3/2019-6/2020) In 2021, I assembled curriculum for and taught Python and Data Analytics for 2 Savvy Coder cohorts. I have in 2018 completed Launchcode's "Discovery" and "LC-101" programs. I was given a pass for the "Liftoff" program, due to my hard work and coding achievements. I have completed two Gale courses, one on Javascript and one on Visual Basic. I am familiar with Python, Tableau, Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, CSS, HTML, SQL, Splunk, Jira, Visual Basic, Flask, Jinja, Git, AWS, Linux, Ubuntu, RDP, SAAS, Command Line and Computer Science essentials. I have created hundreds of fully functioning web apps. 

I am also well-versed in setting up, tuning-up, dismantling and troubleshooting hardware and software for PCs and Macs, and in preserving and maintaining networks. I can assist with login and password-related issues, physical and wireless connections, personal devices (and related settings and applications), and other essential tech-based needs.
