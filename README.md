# Portfolio-Thomas_Park
Here are materials pertaining to the tech/IT career of Thomas Park (mystifiedthomas at gmail dot com).

I have an avid interest in pursuing a career in web development, use and maintenance of databases, or related technology. I have in 2018 completed Launchcode's "Discovery" and "LC-101" programs. I was given a pass for the "Liftoff" program, due to my hard work and coding achievements, and am now an Apprentice seeking employment. I have completed two Gale courses, one on Javascript and one on Visual Basic. Certificates for these courses can be found in this repository. I am familiar with Python, CSS, HTML, SQL, Visual Basic, Javascript, Flask, Jinja, Git, Razor, c#, NET Core and Computer Science essentials. I have created hundreds of fully functioning web apps. Materials concerning some of these apps may be found in pdfs available at this repository.

The links in the pdfs are not active here at GitHub-- to click through, you would have to download the documents and open them in a browser. So, here are some more direct links:
