# Portfolio-Thomas_Park
Here are materials pertaining to the coding career of Thomas Park (mystifiedthomas at gmail dot com).

I have an avid interest in pursuing a career in web development, use and maintenance of databases, or related technology. I am currently enrolled in the Launchcode program, and am familiar with Python, css, html, sql, flask, jinja, git, c#, NET Core and Computer Science essentials. I have created several fully functioning web apps. Materials concerning these apps may be found in one of several pdfs available at this repository.
