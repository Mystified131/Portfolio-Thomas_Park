# Portfolio-Thomas_Park
Here are materials pertaining to the coding career of Thomas Park (mystifiedthomas at gmail dot com).

I have an avid interest in pursuing a career in web development, use and maintenance of databases, or related technology. I have in 2018 completed Launchcode's "Discovery" and "LC-101" programs. I was given a pass for the "Liftoff" program, due to my hard work and coding achievements, and am now working at the Apprenticeship level, I am familiar with Python, css, html, sql, flask, jinja, git, Razor, c#, NET Core and Computer Science essentials. I have created several fully functioning web apps. Materials concerning these apps may be found in one of several pdfs available at this repository.

The links in the pdfs are not active here at GitHub-- to click through, you would have to download the documents and open them in a browser. So, here are some more direct links:
